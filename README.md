# Tech-it-easy
This repository contains my code files from exploring and learning new technologies. 

1. [Asyncio with Backoff/Tenacity:](https://github.com/nafis-neehal/tech-it-easy/blob/main/1_Asyncio_with_Backoff_Tenacity.ipynb) Asyncio helps to do asynchronous programming, helpful when multiple independent LLM API calls and no need for sequential calls. Backoff/Tenacity are two libraries, to write decorator functions to deal with retrying upon failures/time outs/rate limit errors etc.

2. [Python Logging (Basic):](https://github.com/nafis-neehal/tech-it-easy/blob/main/2_Logging_in_Python.ipynb) Logging helps to keep track of all events you want to keep track of. There are ways to format these log messages in any way whatsoever. They are so easier than printing and looking at, especially when there is a loo...ong session and a lot of thing can go wrong!
