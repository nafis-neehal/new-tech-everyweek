# New-Tech-Everyweek
This repository contains my code files from exploring and learning new technologies. 

1. [Asyncio with Backoff/Tenacity:](https://github.com/nafis-neehal/new-tech-everyweek/blob/main/1_Asyncio_with_Backoff_Tenacity.ipynb) Asyncio helps to do asynchronous programming, helpful when multiple independent LLM API calls and no need for sequential calls. Backoff/Tenacity are two libraries, to write decorator functions to deal with retrying upon failures/time outs/rate limit errors etc. .
